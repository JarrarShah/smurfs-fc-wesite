## What the Client Wanted
The Cock & Bottle located in Tarleton, owned by Thwaites Brewery. We created a fresh new look with the manufacture and fitting of signs.

## About the Process:
- Built bespoke oak posts and frames for all the main external signage
- We used a unique process to create a burnt, natural looking logo on the hanging barrel
- Fitted new signage on the front of the building, a hanging sign and internal vinyls
