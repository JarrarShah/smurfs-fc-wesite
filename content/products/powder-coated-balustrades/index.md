## Elevate Your Space with Powder Coated Balustrades by Metal Workers

Powder coated finishes have captured the hearts of many Metal Workers customers for their captivating visual appeal and remarkable versatility. These finishes offer exceptional durability and come in an extensive array of colors, making them adaptable to any project, regardless of its size or specific requirements.

## The Modern Alternative: Powder Coating

Powder coating presents a contemporary alternative to traditional wet or spray painting methods. Unlike liquid paint, powder coating is applied as a dry powder, eliminating the need for solvents to maintain the suspension of binder and filler components. This process entails the application of a high-integrity, robust polyester coating through electrostatic spray onto pre-treated metal, followed by curing in an oven to achieve a smooth and resilient finish. Powder coating is suitable for a wide range of outdoor applications, including:

- Staircase Balustrades
- Balconies
- Terraces
- Decking Features
- Platforms
