## Exploring Residential Balustrades and Their Purpose

Residential balustrades, found within homes, serve as specialized handrails primarily installed along staircases and balconies or terraces. Typically constructed from glass or metal and available in various sizes and designs to suit your preferences, their core function is to ensure safety by preventing falls while also enhancing the aesthetic appeal of your living space. Glass residential balustrades, in particular, lend a modern and sleek finish to your home's exterior design.

## Why Opt for Residential Balustrades in Your Home

Residential balustrades play a pivotal role in enhancing your home's interior and exterior spaces. They not only provide safety by preventing falls from balconies or terraces but also contribute to the overall visual appeal of your residence. Additionally, they assist in noise reduction, effectively blocking unwanted external sounds.

## Balcony Handrails

Balcony handrails serve as crucial safety features, especially for balconies lacking railings or balustrades. They also offer protection when installed on staircases.

## Available Balustrade Styles

Residential balustrades are a highly sought-after choice for homeowners, offering customization in terms of styles and materials. They can be installed on the ground or on a wall, providing versatility to suit your preferences. The three primary types of residential balustrades to consider are glass, stainless steel, and frameless handrails, each with its own set of advantages and considerations.

## Installation Process Overview

Installing a balustrade is a straightforward process, although it does require time and some preparatory work. The duration of a complete installation, ranging from a few hours to several days, depends on the project's scale. The typical process involves securing the area around the balustrade, cutting and installing the new balustrade, and finishing with grinding and sealing. For a quicker solution, we offer a supply-only service if you prefer self-installation or hiring an expert.
