## Metal Workers: Crafting Exceptional Staircases

At Metal Workers, we specialize in designing and constructing top-tier staircases tailored for both commercial and residential purposes. With a foundation established in 1982, we have a wealth of experience in producing staircases for a wide clientele, ranging from corporate giants like Tesco, Moss Bros, and Sainsbury's to individualized, custom-made staircases for domestic and residential customers.

Depending on your preferences and project requirements, we offer an extensive array of materials, styles, and expertise to create staircases that are entirely distinctive and personalized. Our staircases span a broad spectrum of design styles, with many of the latest designs incorporating a fusion of wood, metal, and glass.

## Metal Workers Offers:

- Professional collaboration with designers, architects, and builders.
- High-quality, visually appealing staircase and balustrade products.
- A comprehensive range of premium materials, including wood, metal, and glass.
- Strict adherence to all prevailing building regulations.

We provide turnkey project management, commencing from initial client meetings and conceptualization, through the design phase, and culminating in the manufacturing process.

Our shipping services ensure next-day delivery for destinations in the UK and Ireland, with a few exceptions in more remote areas.
