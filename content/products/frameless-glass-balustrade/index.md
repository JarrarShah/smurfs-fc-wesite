## Discover the Beauty of Frameless Elegance

Elevate your surroundings with the exquisite frameless glass balustrade systems by Metal Workers. These balustrades offer a breathtaking perspective while ensuring safety through toughened or laminated glass, combined with sleek fittings and minimalist design. Our in-house design and engineering experts craft functional glass barriers that not only enhance aesthetics but also prioritize safety and reliability.

## Tailored to Your Needs

Our frameless glass balustrade systems are versatile and adaptable to various project applications, whether it's staircases, internal level changes, or external balconies. These systems can be securely fixed at the base or on the sides, offering the utmost flexibility. Moreover, the application of weather-proof coatings ensures durability and longevity even when exposed to the elements.

## Customization at Its Best

Enhance the visual appeal and functionality of your frameless glass balustrade systems with a range of fixtures and fittings, including caps, handles, handrails, and various edging details. Tailor your balustrades to complement your specific design requirements.

## The Essence of Frameless Elegance

Frameless glass balustrades redefine aesthetics by eliminating traditional frames. The strength of these balustrades stems from the glass itself, creating an immediate impression and adding a perfect aesthetic touch to any room. Most frameless glass balustrades use tempered glass, renowned for its exceptional strength and durability.

## Thickness Matters

For optimum safety, frameless glass balustrades should feature toughened glass with a minimum thickness of 12mm. In commercial applications or crowd control scenarios, the thickness may need to increase to 31.5mm to meet safety standards.

## Laminated Glass for Added Strength

Laminated glass is a suitable option for frameless balustrades, providing added strength. However, it's important to note that laminated glass balustrades typically require greater thickness compared to their tempered glass counterparts in commercial settings.

## Secure Installation

While frameless glass balustrades lack traditional frames, they still require secure fittings to integrate seamlessly into the structure. Many of these balustrades use a robust "channel system" fixed by resin studs or bolts. Recent advancements in research and development have introduced methods for secure yet removable glass installation.

## Balustrade Bases

Balustrade bases are fixed to the underlying structure, ensuring stability and safety. The choice of base depends on factors such as the product type and expected load. Our experts will guide you in selecting the most suitable option.

## Considerable Weight

Frameless glass balustrades can be exceptionally heavy due to the weight of the glass itself. It's essential to ensure that the underlying structure can support the balustrade, especially for larger installations.

## Handrails and Top Capping

While most frameless balustrades do not include handrails or top capping, these additions can enhance both aesthetics and safety. Top capping, available in various finishes such as chrome or metallic, can improve structural integrity and provide added height.

## Safety First

Safety is a top priority for frameless glass balustrades. Tempered glass, known for its strength and unique properties, ensures safety even under load. Rest assured that frameless glass balustrades are designed with your safety in mind.
